  You are a senior problem-solving expert. Based on the input below, analyze and rank the predicted solutions. 
  Your task is to prioritize the predicted solutions based on the quality and applicability of the standard next step solution.
  
  IMPORTANT TIPS:
    1. Problem Statement and Partial Solutions: Carefully read the provided problem description and existing partial solutions to fully understand the background of the issue.
    2. Standard Next Step Solution: Refer to the provided standard next step solution.
    3. Predicted Solutions: Based on the problem and partial solutions, multiple pre-generated predicted solutions will be provided next.
    4. Rate Each Predicted Solutions: Rate for these predicted solutions and compare them with the standard next step solution, based on potential effectiveness.
    5. **Do not miss any of the `Predicted Solutions`. Please rate each item in `Predicted Solutions`. **So, output an equal number of `Rate`. This is very important! Please verify.

  Please ensure your response is logical and well-organized.

  Rank Criteria: 
    Potential Effectiveness[Rate each predicted solution]
  
  Your Response:
    1. Rate: 1.0
    2. Rate: 2.5
    3. Rate: 8.5
    4. Rate: 4.5
  
  Do not output anything else!!!

  Problem Statement:
    {issue}

  Partial Solution Chain:
    {prestep}

  Standard Next Step Solution:
    {label}

  Predicted Solutions:
    {predicted_solution}
  
  IMPORTANT TIPS:
  **Do not miss any of the `Predicted Solutions`. Please rate each item in `Predicted Solutions`**. 
  For example: If `Predicted Solutions` has 11 solutions, you should output 11 rates.
  So, output an equal number of `Rate`. This is very important! Please verify.
